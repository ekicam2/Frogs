# Frogs

Basic rail shooter made using Unity3D game engine. Project at the moment is completely dead but is compiling and giving kind of fun.
####I'm uploading WHOLE project folder without .gitignore!
### Things done
* waves
* multiple enemies
* two guns
* god mode //it's not a bug it's a feature ;)
* a basic menu
* one level
### Things that should be done
* the player should be killable //again it's a feature
* there should be something like a boss
* a shop would be nice to be implemented too, at the moment there is no way to spend earned money
* and many many things that would meke a real game from that!
