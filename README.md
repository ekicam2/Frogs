# Frogs

Basic rail shooter made using Unity3D game engine. Project at the moment is completely dead but is compiling and giving kind of fun.
!!!I'm uploading WHOLE project folder without .gitignore!!!
### Things done
* waves
* multiple enemies
* two guns
* god mode //it's not a bug it's a feature ;)
* a basic menu
* one level
### Things that should be done
* the player should be killable //again it's a feature
* there should be something like a boss
* a shop would be nice to be implemented too, at the moment there is no way to spend earned money
* and many many things that would meke a real game from that!
